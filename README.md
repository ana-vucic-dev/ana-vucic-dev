## Hi, I'm Ana 👋

I'm a full-stack web developer in training. I enjoy problem-solving, back-end logic, and building apps that bring ideas to life.

## 🚀 What I'm working on
- **YelpCamp clone** — my bootcamp capstone project (Express, MongoDB, Node.js, EJS)
- Small side projects — experimenting and learning by doing

## 🌱 Currently learning
- Node.js, Express, and MongoDB
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Sharpening my full-stack development skills

## 💡 About me
- I love coding challenges where I get to figure out *why* something isn’t working and fix it.
- I’m curious, detail-oriented, and excited to grow as a developer.
