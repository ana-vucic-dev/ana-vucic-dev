# 👋 Hi, I'm Ana

I'm a front-end-focused developer with a background in content and technical writing. I build JavaScript-driven UI projects with an emphasis on **correctness, clean architecture, and user-centric testing**, especially in logic-heavy interfaces where predictable behavior matters.

## 🧩 What I’ve Been Building

### 🔢 Scientific JavaScript Calculator

A fully keyboard-accessible **vanilla JavaScript** calculator with a custom expression parser, deterministic error handling, and extensive unit, property-based, and integration tests.

**Key focus areas:**

- Input handling implemented as a state machine
- Tokenization and Shunting-Yard expression parsing
- Evaluation logic based on Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)
- Edge-case and invalid-input testing
- Clean, readable, and debuggable code

🔗 Live demo: coming soon

🔗 Source code: in final review

### 🎮 Game Projects

- Tic-Tac-Toe — multiple implementations exploring different UI and logic approaches
- Rock–Paper–Scissors — focus on clean state handling and predictable behavior

### 🧮 Core JavaScript Projects

- Standard calculator
- Small, focused logic challenges published progressively

## 🛠️ Tech I Use Comfortably

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Bootstrap
- Vitest & fast-check
- Git & GitHub
- Linux (Ubuntu — daily driver)

## 💙 What I Care About

- Correctness over cleverness
- Readable, maintainable code
- Testability & predictable UI behavior
- Accessibility (keyboard navigation & ARIA standards)
- Responsive web design

## 📌 Currently

- Polishing and publishing portfolio projects
- Exploring React again at a sustainable pace
- Strengthening testing and application architecture skills

## 🎓 Background

Before transitioning into front-end development, I spent nearly a decade working as a content writer and editor, where precision, structure, and user-focused thinking were central to my work.

That background — together with a BA in English Language and Literature — shapes how I structure code, approach problem-solving, write documentation, and think about user-facing clarity.

Earlier learning projects also include a full-stack web application built with Node.js, Express, EJS templating, and MongoDB as part of coursework.
