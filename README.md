# 👋 Hi, I'm Ana

I'm a front-end-focused developer with a background in content and technical writing. I build JavaScript-driven UI projects with an emphasis on **correctness, clean architecture, and user-centric testing**, especially in logic-heavy interfaces where predictable behavior matters.

## 🧩 What I’ve Been Building

### 🔢 Scientific JavaScript Calculator

A fully keyboard-accessible **vanilla JavaScript** calculator with a custom expression parser, deterministic error handling, and extensive unit, property-based, and integration tests.

**Key focus areas:**

- Input handling implemented as a state machine

- Tokenization and Shunting-Yard expression parsing

- Evaluation logic based on Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)

- Edge-case and invalid-input testing

- Clean, readable, and debuggable code

### 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe (Minimax AI)

A vanilla JavaScript implementation featuring persistent state management and a minimax-based AI opponent with controlled randomness for more human-like play.

**Key focus areas:**

- Deterministic game logic

- AI decision tree evaluation (Minimax)

- State persistence across rounds

- Clear separation of UI and game logic

## 🛠️ Tech I Use Comfortably

- JavaScript (ES6+)

- HTML5 & CSS3

- TypeScript (type-safe UI logic & form state modeling)

- Bootstrap

- Vitest & fast-check

- Git & GitHub

- Linux (Ubuntu — daily driver)

## 💙 What I Care About

- Correctness over cleverness

- Readable, maintainable code

- Testability & predictable UI behavior

- Accessibility (keyboard navigation & ARIA standards)

- Responsive web design

## 📌 Currently

- Deepening React fundamentals and modern state management patterns

- Applying TypeScript for safer and more predictable UI logic

- Refining testing strategies and architectural decision-making

- Polishing and publishing production-ready portfolio projects

## 🎓 Background

Before transitioning into front-end development, I spent nearly a decade working as a content writer and editor, where precision, structure, and user-focused thinking were central to my work.

That background — together with a BA in English Language and Literature — shapes how I structure code, approach problem-solving, write documentation, and think about user-facing clarity.

Earlier learning projects also include a full-stack web application built with Node.js, Express, EJS templating, and MongoDB as part of coursework.
